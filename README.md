## 💡 Introduction

This is an implementation of Road Traffic Congestion prediction Using Back Propagation Neural Network.

Requires Keras with a Tensorflow backend in addition to standard packages such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `sklearn`.

The Neural Network was trained and tested on the **_US101 Highway data_ from the  Next Generation Simulation dataset (NGSIM)**.
