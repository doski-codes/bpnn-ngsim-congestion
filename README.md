# Neural Network

## 1. Introduction

This is an implementation of Road Traffic Congestion prediction using a back propagation Neural Network.

The neural network is built using Keras with a Tensorflow backend.

The **_US101 Highway data_ from the  Next Generation Simulation dataset (NGSIM)** was used to build the model.

## 2. Environment

To install the packages used in this project and you would require `conda`.

After cloning the repository run the following commands:
    `cd bpnn-ngsim-congestion`
    `conda env create -f environment.yml`

Now run the command `conda activate deeplearning_env` to activate the conda environment with the required packages.

You can run `conda deactivate` to deactivate the environment.

## 3. Dataset

The fact sheet for the US101 Next Generation Simulation dataset (NGSIM) can be found [here](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/07030/07030.pdf).
