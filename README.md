Artificial Neural Network

This is an implementation of Road Traffic Congestion prediction Using Back Propagation Neural Network

The Neural Network was trained and tested on the US101 Highway data from the  Next Generation Simulation dataset (NGSIM)

bpnn.py contains code for training and testing on 13 columns of the dataset.
real.py contains code for training on much fewer columns of the dataset.
